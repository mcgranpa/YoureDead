# YoureDead
 Game Dev TV Game Jam 2022

This is version 1.0.  

There is an easy and hard level.  You can select from the Main Menu.   
You are dead.  You start out as a ghost.   You can't die again, but you can lose points.
You must find your way out to become live again.    Try to get as high score as possible while trying to escape the dungeon.  
Movement A/W/S/D or arrow keys.
ESC key will end the game.  There is no "are you sure" warning!  
There may be clues to the direction to follow in the form of arrows on the ground.  They will not lead you wrong. 
Shoot with left mouse button.  Aim with the mouse pointer. 
Avoid bats.  If they touch you, you lose points.  You can kill them by shooting them. 
Get points by collecting coins and eating frogs and killing bats.  Why frogs.  No reason.  
There are locked doors in the dungeon.  You will need a key that matches the color of the door.  Once you open the door you lose the key.  There's enough keys to open all the doors.
